# Survey Weights
{: .no_toc}

The symptom survey individual response files contain survey weights calculated
by Facebook. Facebook has provided documentation to describe the calculation and
usage of these weights, [available here](symptom-survey-weights.pdf). This
documentation explains the weight methodology, gives examples of how to use the
weights when calculating estimates, and states the known limitations of the
weights.
