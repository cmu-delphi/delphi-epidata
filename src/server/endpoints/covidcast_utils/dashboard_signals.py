# Provides a list of `(source, signal)` tuples that enumerate those used by the
# COVIDcast Dashboard, found at https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/

# This module uses two files in this current directory as a resource: `descriptions.raw.txt` & `questions.raw.txt`.
# These files are sourced from (and should be kept in sync with) files of the same name from the `www-covidcast`
# repository, found at https://github.com/cmu-delphi/www-covidcast/blob/dev/src/stores/ .  As part of the
# "Create Release" github action for `www-covidcast`, a pull request is created in this repository (`delphi-epidata`)
# with any updates to these files (see:
# https://github.com/cmu-delphi/www-covidcast/blob/dev/.github/workflows/create_release.yml for more details).
