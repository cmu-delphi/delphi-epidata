Name: Symptom Searches (Smell and Taste) on Google 
Id: google-symptoms
Signal: s05_smoothed_search
Unit: scaled search volume

SignalTooltip: Google search volume of COVID-related symptom searches about smell and taste
 
Description: Using Google Symptoms Searches, Delphi obtains the average of Google search volumes for searches related to anosmia (loss of smell), ageusia (loss of taste), and dysgeusia (altered or impaired taste) in each area, since they emerged as unusual symptoms that can be indicative of COVID-19. Note that the average of the three symptom search volumes is not equivalent to the search volume of their union. According to Google, the estimates are not comparable across regions since the values are normalized by population and scaled by region-specific maximum popularity (and for this reason, we omit beehive grids and choropleth maps of this signal on the dashboard).

Id: google-symptoms
Signal: s02_smoothed_search

SignalTooltip: Google search volume of COVID-related symptom searches about common cold
 
Description: Using Google Symptoms Searches, Delphi obtains the average of Google search volumes for searches related to nasal congestion, post nasal drip, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, rhinitis, and common cold in each area. These symptoms have shown positive correlation with reported COVID cases, especially since Omicron was declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organization. Note that the average search volume of these symptoms is not equivalent to the search volume of their union. According to Google, the estimates are not comparable across regions since the values are normalized by population and scaled by region-specific maximum popularity (and for this reason, we omit beehive grids and choropleth maps of this signal on the dashboard).

Signal: smoothed_adj_cli
Unit: per 100 visits


SignalTooltip: Percentage of daily doctor visits that are due to COVID-like symptoms


Description: Delphi receives aggregated statistics from health system partners on COVID-related outpatient doctor visits, derived from ICD codes found in insurance claims. Using this data, we estimate the percentage of daily doctor’s visits in each area that are due to COVID-like illness. Note that these estimates are based only on visits by patients whose data is accessible to our partners.
