quidel,quidel,Quidel Inc.,"Data source based on COVID-19 Antigen tests, provided to us by Quidel, Inc. When a patient (whether at a doctor's office, clinic, or hospital) has COVID-like symptoms, doctors may order an antigen test. An antigen test can detect parts of the virus that are present during an active infection. This is in contrast with antibody tests, which detect parts of the immune system that react to the virus, but which persist long after the infection has passed. Quidel began providing us with test data starting May 9, 2020, and data volume increased to statistically meaningful levels starting May 26, 2020.",covid_ag_smoothed_pct_positive ,CC BY,https://cmu.box.com/s/sax48yxnahllrnbqlq6wqxblg6lsyq24,[API Documentation](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/quidel.html)

google-symptoms,google-symptoms,Google Symptoms Search Trends,"This data source is based on the [COVID-19 Search Trends symptoms dataset](http://goo.gle/covid19symptomdataset). Using this search data, we estimate the volume of searches mapped to symptoms related to COVID-19 such as anosmia (lack of smell) and ageusia(lack of taste). The resulting daily dataset for each region shows the relative frequency of searches for each symptom. The signals are measured in arbitrary units that are normalized for overall search users in the region and scaled by the maximum value of the normalized popularity within a geographic region across a specific time range. Thus, values are NOT comparable across geographic regions. Larger numbers represent increased releative popularity of symptom-related searches.",anosmia_smoothed_search,"To download or use the data, you must agree to the Google [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms)",,[API Documentation](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/google-symptoms.html)
