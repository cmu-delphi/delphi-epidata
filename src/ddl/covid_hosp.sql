NOTES:
There is a `date` column from the time series data which indicates the
date corresponding to the values.
For daily snapshot files, there is a `reporting_cutoff_start` value,
defined as "Look back date start - The latest reports from each hospital
is summed for this report starting with this date." We place this value
into the `date` column.

We also add a column `record_type` that specifies if a row came from a
time series file or a daily snapshot file. "T" = time series and
"D" =  daily snapshot. When both a time series and a daily snapshot row
have the same issue/date/state but different values, we tiebreak by
taking the daily snapshot value. This is done with a window function that
sorts by the record_type field, ascending, and so it is important that "D"
comes before "T".

- `id`
  unique identifier for each record
- `publication_date`
  the day (YYYYMMDD) that the dataset was published. equivalent to `issue` in
  the state timeseries and metadata tables, but renamed here for clarity.

NOTE: `collection_week` is the first day (YYYYMMDD) of the week to which the
data applies. this is a weekly rollup of daily data from friday to thursday. as
a result, we can't use sunday-to-saturday epiweeks (YYYYMM) to identify the
week, so we instead use the date of friday, as is done in the upstream data
source.

NOTE: Names have been shortened to 64 characters, as this is a technical
limitation of the database. Affected names are:
