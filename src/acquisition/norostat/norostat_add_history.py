"""
Parses historical versions of the NoroSTAT data-table and updates the
appropriate databases. Currently uses snapshots from the WayBack Machine
(archive.org). A more comprehensive archival service may be mementoweb.org,
which appears to pull from many services that implement the Memento protocol,
including archive.org. Manually downloaded snapshots could be recorded via this
script as well.
