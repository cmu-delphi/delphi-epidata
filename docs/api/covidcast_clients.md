# COVIDcast Libraries

To access COVIDcast data, we recommend using the following client libraries:

- R: [epidatr](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epidatr/),
- Python: [covidcast](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcast-py/html/) (soon to be replaced with [epidatpy](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epidatpy)).

These packages provide a convenient way to obtain COVIDcast data as a data frame
ready to be used in further analyses and provide convenient mapping and analysis
functions. For installation instructions and examples, consult their respective
webpages.

To access Epidata datasets on other diseases, visit our
[Epidata API Client Libraries](client_libraries.md) documentation.
