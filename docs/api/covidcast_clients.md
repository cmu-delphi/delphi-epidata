# COVIDcast Libraries

Dedicated COVIDcast access and analysis libraries are available for several languages:

* R: [covidcast](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/)
* Python: [covidcast](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcast-py/html/)

These packages provide a convenient way to obtain COVIDcast data as a data frame
ready to be used in further analyses and provide convenient mapping and
analysis functions. For installation instructions and examples, consult their
respective webpages.
