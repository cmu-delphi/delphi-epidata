# Delphi's COVID-19 Data Sources and Signals

Delphi's COVID-19 Surveillance Streams data includes the following data sources.
Data from these sources is expected to be updated daily. You can use the
[`covidcast_meta`](covidcast_meta.md) API endpoint to get summary information
about the ranges of the different attributes for the different data sources.

The API for retrieving data from these sources is described in the
[COVIDcast API endpoint documentation](covidcast.md). Changes and corrections to
data in this API are listed in the [API changelog](covidcast_changelog.md).

To obtain many of these signals and update them daily, Delphi has written
extensive software to obtain data from various sources, aggregate the data,
calculate statistical estimates, and format the data to be shared through the
COVIDcast API. This code is [open source and available on
GitHub](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/covidcast-indicators), and contributions
are welcome.

## COVIDcast Map Signals

The following signals are currently displayed on [the public COVIDcast
map](https://covidcast.cmu.edu/):
