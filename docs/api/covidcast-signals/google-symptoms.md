## Overview

This data source is based on the [COVID-19 Search Trends symptoms
dataset](http://goo.gle/covid19symptomdataset). Using
this search data, we estimate the volume of searches mapped to symptoms related
to COVID-19 such as _anosmia_ (lack of smell) and _ageusia_(lack of taste). The
resulting daily dataset for each region shows the relative frequency of searches
for each symptom. The signals are measured in arbitrary units that are
normalized for overall search users in the region and scaled by the maximum value of the normalized
popularity within a geographic region across a specific time range. **Thus,
values are NOT comparable across geographic regions**. Larger numbers represent
increased releative popularity of symptom-related searches.

## Estimation
The `sum_anosmia_ageusia_raw_search` signals are simply the raw sum of the
 values of `anosmia_raw_search` and `ageusia_raw_search`, but not the union of
 anosmia and ageusia related searches. This is because the data volume is
 calculated based on search queries. A single search query can be mapped to more
 than one symptom. Currently, Google does not provide _intersection/union_
 data. Users should be careful when considering such signals.

## Geographical Aggregation
The state-level and county-level `raw_search` signals for specific symptoms such
as _anosmia_ and _ageusia_ are taken directly from the [COVID-19 Search Trends
symptoms
dataset](https://github.com/google-research/open-covid-19-data/tree/master/data/exports/search_trends_symptoms_dataset)
without changes. We aggregate the county-level data to the MSA and HRR levels
using the population-weighted average. For MSAs/HRRs that include counties that
have no data provided due to quality or privacy issues for a certain day, we
simply assume the values to be 0 during aggregation. The values for MSAs/HRRs
with no counties having non-NaN values will not be reported. Thus, the resulting
MSA/HRR level data does not fully match the _actual_ MSA/HRR level data (which
we are not provided).

## Lag and Backfill
Google does not currently update the search data daily, but usually twice a week.
Each update will usually extend the coverage to within three days of the day of the update.
As a result the delay can range from 3 to 10 days or even more. We check for
updates every day and provide the most up-to-date data.

## Limitations 
When daily volume in a region does not meet quality or privacy thresholds, set
by Google, no daily value is reported. Weekly data may be available from Google 
in these cases, but we do not yet support importation using weekly data.

Google uses differential privacy, which adds artificial noise to the raw
datasets to avoid identifying any individual persons without affecting the
quality of results.

Google normalizes and scales time series values to determine the relative
popularity of symptoms in searches within each geographical region individually.
This means that the resulting values of symptom popularity are **NOT**
comparable across geographic regions.
