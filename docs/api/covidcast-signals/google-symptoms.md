## Overview

This data source is based on the [COVID-19 Search Trends symptoms
dataset](http://goo.gle/covid19symptomdataset). Using
this search data, we estimate the volume of searches mapped to symptom sets related
to COVID-19. The resulting daily dataset for each region shows the average relative frequency of searches for each symptom set. The signals are measured in arbitrary units that are normalized for overall search users in the region and scaled by the maximum value of the normalized popularity within a geographic region across a specific time range. **Values are comparable across signals in the same location but NOT across geographic regions**. For example, within a state, we can compare `s01_smoothed_search` and `s02_smoothed_search`. However, we cannot compare `s01_smoothed_search` between states. Larger numbers represent increased relative popularity of symptom-related searches.

#### Symptom sets

* _s01_: Cough, Phlegm, Sputum, Upper respiratory tract infection
* _s02_: Nasal congestion, Post nasal drip, Rhinorrhea, Sinusitis, Rhinitis, Common cold
* _s03_: Fever, Hyperthermia, Chills, Shivering, Low grade fever
* _s04_: Shortness of breath, Wheeze, Croup, Pneumonia, Asthma, Crackles, Acute bronchitis, Bronchitis
* _s05_: Anosmia, Dysgeusia, Ageusia
* _s06_: Laryngitis, Sore throat, Throat irritation
* _scontrol_: Type 2 diabetes, Urinary tract infection, Hair loss, Candidiasis, Weight gain

The symptoms were combined in sets that showed positive correlation with cases, especially after Omicron was declared a variant of concern by the WHO. Note that symptoms in _scontrol_ are not COVID-19 related, and this symptom set can be used as a negative control.

Until January 20, 2022, we had separate signals for symptoms Anosmia, Ageusia, and their sum.

## Estimation
Each signal is the average of the
 values of search trends for each symptom in the symptom set. For example, `s05_raw_search` is the average of the search trend values of anosmia, ageusia, and dysgeusia. Note that this is different from the union of
 anosmia, ageusia, and dysgeusia related searches divided by 3, because the data volume for each symptom is calculated based on search queries. A single search query can be mapped to more than one symptom. Currently, Google does not provide _intersection/union_
 data. Users should be careful when considering such signals.

 For each symptom set: when search trends for all symptoms are missing, the signal is reported as missing. When search trends are available for at least one of the symptoms, we fill the missing trends for other symptoms with 0 and compute the average. We use this approach because the missing observations in the Google Symptoms search trends dataset do not occur randomly; they represent low popularity and are censored for quality and/or privacy reasons. The same approach is used for smoothed signals. A 7 day moving average is used, and missing raw signals are filled with 0 as long as there is at least one day available within the 7 day window.



## Geographical Aggregation
The state-level and county-level `raw_search` signals for each symptoms set are the average of its individual symptoms search trends, taken directly from the [COVID-19 Search Trends
symptoms
dataset](https://github.com/google-research/open-covid-19-data/tree/master/data/exports/search_trends_symptoms_dataset).

We aggregate county and state data to other geographic levels using
population-weighted averaging.

| Source level | Aggregated level |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| county       | MSA, HRR         |
| state        | HHS, nation      |

For aggregation purposes only, we assign a value of 0 to source regions that
have no data provided due to quality or privacy issues for a certain day (see
Limitations for details). We do not report aggregated regions if none of their
source regions have data. Because of this censoring behavior, the resulting data
for aggregated regions does not fully match the _actual_ search volume for these
regions (which is not provided to us).

## Lag and Backfill
Google does not currently update the search data daily, but usually twice a week.
Each update will usually extend the coverage to within three days of the day of the update.
As a result the delay can range from 3 to 10 days or even more. We check for
updates every day and provide the most up-to-date data.

## Limitations
When daily volume in a region does not meet quality or privacy thresholds, set
by Google, no daily value is reported. Weekly data may be available from Google
in these cases, but we do not yet support importation using weekly data.

Google uses differential privacy, which adds artificial noise to the raw
datasets to avoid identifying any individual persons without affecting the
quality of results.

Google normalizes and scales time series values to determine the relative
popularity of symptoms in searches within each geographical region individually.
This means that the resulting values of symptom set popularity are **NOT**
comparable across geographic regions, while the values of different symptom sets are comparable within the same location.
