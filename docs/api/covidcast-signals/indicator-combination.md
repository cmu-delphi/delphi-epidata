These signals combine the cases and deaths data from JHU and USA Facts. This is
a straight composition: the signals below use the [JHU signal data](jhu-csse.md)
for Puerto Rico, and the [USA Facts signal data](usa-facts.md) everywhere else.
Consult each signal's documentation for information about geographic reporting,
backfill, and other limitations.
