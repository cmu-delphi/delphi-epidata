# Delphi's Epidata Data Sources and Signals

Delphi's Epidata endpoints include the following data sources.
Most of these sources are updated weekly.
Unlike [the main endpoint](covidcast.md), the format of different Epidata endpoints varies.
The API for retrieving data from these sources is described in the
[API clients documentation](client_libraries.md).

To obtain many of these signals and update them daily, Delphi has written
extensive software to obtain data from various sources, aggregate the data,
calculate statistical estimates, and format the data to be shared through the Delphi Epidata API.
This code is
[open source and available on GitHub](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/delphi-epidata),
and contributions are welcome.
