# COVID-19 Hospitalization: Facility Lookup

This endpoint is a companion to the
[`covid_hosp_facility` endpoint](covid_hosp_facility.md). It provides a way to
find unique identifiers and other metadata for facilities of interest.

Metadata is derived from the "COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital
Capacity by Facility" dataset provided by the US Department of Health & Human
Services via healthdata.gov.

See the
[official description and data dictionary at healthdata.gov](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/anag-cw7u)
for more information.

General topics not specific to any particular data source are discussed in the
[API overview](README.md). Such topics include:
[contributing](README.md#contributing) and [citing](README.md#citing).
