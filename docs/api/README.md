# Epidata API (Other Diseases)

This is the home of [Delphi](https://delphi.cmu.edu/)'s epidemiological data
API for tracking epidemics such as influenza, dengue, and norovirus. Note that
our work on COVID-19 is described in the [COVIDcast Epidata API documentation](covidcast.md).

## Contributing

If you are interested in contributing:

- For development of the API itself, see the
  [development guide](../epidata_development.md).
- To suggest changes, additions, or other ways to improve,
  [open an issue](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/delphi-epidata/issues/new)
  describing your idea.

## Citing

We hope that this API is useful to others outside of our group, especially for
epidemiological and other scientific research. If you use this API and would
like to cite it, we would gratefully recommend the following copy:

# The API

The base URL is: https://delphi.cmu.edu/epidata/api.php

## Specifying Epiweeks, Dates, and Lists

Epiweeks use the U.S. definition. That is, the first epiweek each year is the
week, starting on a Sunday, containing January 4. See
[this page](https://www.cmmcp.org/mosquito-surveillance-data/pages/epi-week-calendars-2008-2020)
for more information.

Formatting for epiweeks is YYYYWW and for dates is YYYYMMDD.

`list` parameters consist of a comma-separated list of individual values or, for numeric parameters, a hyphenated range of values. Examples include:
 - `param=201530` *(A single epiweek)*
 - `param=201401,201501,201601` *(Several epiweeks)*
 - `param=200501-200552` *(A range of epiweeks)*
 - `param=201440,201501-201510` *(Several epiweeks, including a range)*
 - `param=20070101-20071231` *(A range of dates)*

## Universal Parameters

The only universally required parameter is `endpoint`, which must be one of the supported source names listed below, e.g., `fluview`.

## Source-Specific Parameters

The parameters available for each source are documented in each linked source-specific API page.
