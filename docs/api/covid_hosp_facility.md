# COVID-19 Hospitalization by Facility

This data source is a mirror of the "COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and
Hospital Capacity by Facility" dataset provided by the US Department of Health
& Human Services via healthdata.gov.

See the
[official description and data dictionary at healthdata.gov](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/anag-cw7u)
for more information.

General topics not specific to any particular data source are discussed in the
[API overview](README.md). Such topics include:
[contributing](README.md#contributing) and [citing](README.md#citing).

## Metadata

This data source provides various measures of COVID-19 burden on patients and healthcare in the US.
- Data source: [US Department of Health & Human Services](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/anag-cw7u) (HHS)
- Geographic resolution: healthcare facility (address, city, zip, fips)
- Temporal resolution: weekly (Friday -- Thursday)
- First week: 2020-07-31
- Open access via [Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/)
- Versioned by Delphi according to the date that the dataset was published by
HHS. New versions are expected to be published roughly weekly.

# The API

The base URL is: https://delphi.cmu.edu/epidata/api.php

See [this documentation](README.md) for details on specifying locations and dates.

## Parameters

### Required

| Parameter | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hospital_pks` | facility unique identifiers | `list` of identifiers |
| `collection_weeks` | dates | `list` of dates or date ranges |

NOTE: The companion
[`covid_hosp_facility_lookup` endpoint](covid_hosp_facility_lookup.md) can be
used to lookup facility identifiers in a variety of ways.

NOTE: A collection week spans Friday -- Thursday, and weeks are identified by
the date corresponding to the Friday at the start of the week. Therefore, the
`collection_weeks` parameter is formatted as a `YYYYMMDD` date (or list of
dates) rather than an "epiweek" as in other endpoints.

### Optional

| Parameter | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `publication_dates` | date of publication | `list` of "issue" dates or date ranges |

If `publication_dates` is not specified, then the most recent issue is used by
default.

NOTE: The `publication_dates` parameter is semantically equivalent to the
`issues` parameter in the related [`covid_hosp` endpoint](covid_hosp.md). It
has been renamed here for clarity.

## Response

| Field | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `result` | result code: 1 = success, 2 = too many results, -2 = no results | integer |
| `epidata` | list of results | array of objects |
| `epidata[].hospital_pk` | facility identified by this row | string |
| `epidata[].collection_week` | Friday's date in the week pertaining to this row | integer |
| `epidata[].publication_date` | the date on which the dataset containing this row was published | integer |
| `epidata[].*` | see the [data dictionary](https://healthdata.gov/covid-19-reported-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-facility-data-dictionary) |  |
| `message` | `success` or error message | string |

# Code Samples

Libraries are available for [CoffeeScript](../../src/client/delphi_epidata.coffee), [JavaScript](../../src/client/delphi_epidata.js), [Python](../../src/client/delphi_epidata.py), and [R](../../src/client/delphi_epidata.R).
The following sample shows how to import the library and fetch Moses Taylor
Hospital (Scranton, PA) on the first collection week of December 2020 (per most
recent issue).

### Python

Optionally install the package using pip(env):
````bash
pip install delphi-epidata
````

Otherwise, place `delphi_epidata.py` from this repo next to your python script.

````python
# Import
from delphi_epidata import Epidata
# Fetch data
res = Epidata.covid_hosp_facility('390119', Epidata.range(20201201, 20201207))
print(res['result'], res['message'], len(res['epidata']))
````
