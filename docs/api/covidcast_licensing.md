# Licensing for Delphi's COVID-19 Data Streams

When you use data from Delphi's COVIDcast Epidata API, we ask that you attribute
the source and follow the terms of the data's licensing agreement. The API
contains some data streams produced internally by Delphi, which should be
attributed to Delphi, and some republished from other sources, which should be
credited. See below for details.

## Novel Data

These data streams include data produced novelly by Delphi and intentionally and
openly surfaced by Delphi through this API.

We request you attribute our data as follows:

> Data from Delphi COVIDcast. Obtained via the Delphi Epidata API.
> <https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html>

Academic publications may cite our paper:

> Alex Reinhart, Logan Brooks, Maria Jahja, Aaron Rumack, Jingjing Tang, et al.
> (2021). "An open repository of real-time COVID-19 indicators". *Proceedings of
> the National Academy of Sciences* 118 (51) e2111452118.
