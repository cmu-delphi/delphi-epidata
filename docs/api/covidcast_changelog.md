# COVIDcast Signal Changes

When Delphi makes substantial changes to a signal's computation, we will
typically publish it under a new name rather than revising the existing signal.
By contrast, the changes documented here are bug fixes, pipeline repairs, and
minor enhancements.

Changes are also announced via the [COVIDcast API mailing
list](https://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/delphi-covidcast-api), and
we **strongly recommend** that anyone using the API to download data regularly
should subscribe to this list. We will only use the list to announce API
changes, data corrections, and other information relevant to API users.

For current information on how up-to-date our public health and behavior data
is, how much of the country is covered by our public health and behavior data,
and the data versioning effects present in our public health and behavior data,
please see Delphi's [Indicator Status Overview
page](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/indicator-status/).
