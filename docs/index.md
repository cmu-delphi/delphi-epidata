# Epidata API

The Epidata API provides real-time access to epidemiological surveillance data.
It is built and maintained by the Carnegie Mellon University [Delphi research
group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/). The Epidata API includes:

- [COVIDcast data](api/covidcast.md), providing daily updates about COVID-19
  activity across the United States. [API clients](api/covidcast_clients.md) for
  quick access to COVID data are available.
- [Data about other epidemics](api/README.md), including influenza, dengue, and
  other epidemics tracked by Delphi through a variety of data streams.

The Delphi group is extremely grateful for Pedrito Maynard-Zhang for all his
help with the Epidata API [documentation](api/index.md).

Developers interested in modifying or extending this project are directed to
the [Epidata API Development Guide](epidata_development.md).
