# COVID Symptom Survey

Since April 2020, Delphi has conducted a voluntary COVID-19 symptom survey,
distributed daily to users in the United States via a partnership with Facebook.
This survey asks respondents about COVID-like symptoms, their behavior (such as
social distancing), mental health, and economic and health impacts they have
experienced as a result of the pandemic. A high-level overview of the survey is
posted [on the COVIDcast website](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/surveys/).

Aggregate data from this survey is available through the [COVIDcast API](../api/covidcast.md)
as the [`fb-survey` data source](../api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.md).

This documentation is for users who have a signed Data Use Agreement to receive
individual response data from the survey. It describes the survey items, data
coding, data distribution, and the survey weights computed by Facebook. If you
are a researcher and would like to get access to the data, see our page on
getting [data access](data-access.md).

If you have questions about the survey or getting access to data, contact us at
<delphi-survey-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu>.

## Credits

The COVID Symptom Survey is a project of the [Delphi
Group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. The Principal
Investigator is [Alex Reinhart](https://www.refsmmat.com/); Wichada La
Motte-Kerr is Survey Coordinator. The survey protocol is reviewed by the
Carnegie Mellon University Institutional Review Board.

The support of several institutions makes the survey possible. Facebook supports
the survey through recruitment (participants are invited via their News Feed),
survey sampling and weighting procedures, technical assistance in survey design
and implementation, and coordination with researchers and public health
officials. The University of Maryland's Joint Program in Survey Methodology
conducts an [international version of the survey](https://covidmap.umd.edu/),
and we coordinate closely on survey design and implementation. Delphi collects,
aggregates, and distributes the US survey data, and retains ultimate
responsibility for the US survey instrument and data.

We develop the survey collaboratively with data users, public health officials,
and others. If you are interested in getting involved, see our
[collaboration and survey revision information](collaboration-revision.md).

## Citing the Survey

Researchers who use the survey microdata for research are asked to credit and
cite the survey in publications based on the data. Specifically, we ask that
you:

1. Include the acknowledgment "This research is based on survey results from
   Carnegie Mellon University’s Delphi Group."
2. Cite this web page for details about the survey. For example, you may cite it
   as

    > Delphi Group (2020). COVID Symptom Survey.
    > <https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/>

    A journal article describing the survey and its methods is currently in
    preparation, and we will update this page when it is available so that you
    can cite it instead.
3. Send a copy of your publication, once it appears publicly as a preprint or
   journal article, to <delphi-survey-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu>.

Additionally, please note that the data use agreement requires that if you
disclose survey microdata, Delphi must agree on the aggregation method that you
will use to ensure reported estimates do not disclose any individual
identifiable information, including individual survey results. If you are unsure
whether a particular aggregation will prevent disclosure of individual survey
results, please email us at <delphi-survey-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu>.
