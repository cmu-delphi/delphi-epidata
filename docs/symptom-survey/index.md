# COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey

Since April 2020, Delphi has conducted a voluntary survey about COVID-19,
distributed daily to users in the United States via a partnership with Facebook.
This survey asks respondents about COVID-like symptoms, their behavior (such as
social distancing), mental health, and economic and health impacts they have
experienced as a result of the pandemic. A high-level overview of the survey is
posted [on the COVIDcast website](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covid19/ctis/), and an
international version is [conducted by the University of
Maryland](https://covidmap.umd.edu/). Data collection [will cease on June 25, 2022](end-of-survey.md).

The [survey results dashboard](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/survey-results/)
provides a high-level summary of survey results. Geographically aggregated data
from this survey is publicly available through the [COVIDcast API](../api/covidcast.md)
as the [`fb-survey` data source](../api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.md). Demographic breakdowns of survey
data are publicly available as [downloadable contingency tables](contingency-tables.md).

This documentation describes the survey items, data coding, data distribution,
and the survey weights computed by Facebook. It also documents the individual
response data, which is available to researchers with a signed Data Use
Agreement. If you are a researcher and would like to get access to the data, see
our page on getting [data access](data-access.md).

If you have questions about the survey or getting access to data, contact us at

## Credits

The US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) is a project of the [Delphi
Group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. Team members
include:

* [Alex Reinhart](https://www.refsmmat.com/), Principal Investigator
* Wichada La Motte-Kerr, Survey Coordinator
* Robin Mejia, survey advisor
* Nat DeFries, statistical developer and data engineer
* Eu Jing Chua (2020-2021) and Mashrin Srivastava (2021-2022), data analysis
  interns
* plus support from many members of the [Delphi
  team](https://delphi.cmu.edu/about/team/)

The survey protocol is reviewed by the Carnegie Mellon University Institutional
Review Board.

The support of several institutions makes the survey possible. Facebook supports
the survey through recruitment (participants are invited via their News Feed),
survey sampling and weighting procedures, technical assistance in survey design
and implementation, and coordination with researchers and public health
officials. The University of Maryland's Social Data Science Center conducts a
[global version of the survey](https://covidmap.umd.edu/), and we coordinate
closely on survey design and implementation. Delphi collects, aggregates, and
distributes the US survey data, and retains ultimate responsibility for the US
survey instrument and data.

We develop the survey collaboratively with data users, public health officials,
and others. If you are interested in getting involved, see our
[collaboration and survey revision information](collaboration-revision.md).

## Citing the Survey

Researchers who use the US survey data for research are asked to credit and cite
the survey in publications based on the data. Specifically, we ask that you:

1. Include the acknowledgment "This research is based on survey results from
   Carnegie Mellon University’s Delphi Group."
2. Cite our paper describing the survey:

    > Joshua A. Salomon, Alex Reinhart, Alyssa Bilinski, Eu Jing Chua, Wichada
    > La Motte-Kerr, Minttu M. Rönn, Marissa Reitsma, Katherine Ann Morris,
    > Sarah LaRocca, Tamar Farag, Frauke Kreuter, Roni Rosenfeld, and Ryan J.
    > Tibshirani (2021). "The US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey: Continuous
    > real-time measurement of COVID-19 symptoms, risks, protective behaviors,
    > testing, and vaccination", *Proceedings of the National Academy of
    > Sciences* 118 (51) e2111454118. <https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2111454118>

3. The data use agreement requires that if you disclose survey microdata, Delphi
   must agree on the aggregation method that you will use to ensure reported
   estimates do not disclose any individual identifiable information, including
   individual survey results. If you are unsure whether a particular aggregation
   will prevent disclosure of individual survey results, please email us at
   <delphi-survey-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu>.
4. Finally, send a copy of your publication, once it appears publicly as a
   preprint or journal article, to <delphi-survey-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu>.

When referring to the survey in text, we prefer the following formats:

* Long form (such as in an introduction or methods description): "The Delphi
  Group at Carnegie Mellon University U.S. COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, in
  partnership with Facebook".
* Short form (used after the long form has been introduced): "The U.S. COVID-19
  Trends and Impact Survey"
* Acronym form: "Delphi US CTIS"

Prior to July 2021, the survey was known as the COVID Symptom Survey (CSS), and
some older documentation and publications may still refer to this name. We
prefer that new publications and materials refer to the new name.
