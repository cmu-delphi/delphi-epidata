# Data and Sampling Errors
{: .no_toc}

Given the scale of the COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS), we occasionally
encounter data errors or survey implementation problems that affect the
interpretation of results. All problems will be logged here.

## Temporary Suspension (December 16-17, 2021)

Due to a temporary problem affecting Facebook's systems, survey invitations were
suspended between 11:39am PT on December 16, 2021 and 1:20am PT on December
17, 2021. Invitations resumed as usual once the problem was resolved.

## Incorrect Wave Sampling (June-August, 2021)

A sampling error caused a portion of our respondents to be accidentally sent the
Wave 10 survey instrument instead of the newer Wave 11 survey instrument. The
error was fixed on August 2, 2021, but as a result of this error:

* A random 1% of the sample was accidentally sent the W10 instrument between
  June 15 and July 4, 2021.
* A random 3% of the sample was accidentally sent the W10 instrument between
  July 5 and July 11, 2021.
* A random 10% of the sample was accidentally sent the W10 instrument between
  July 12 and July 21, 2021.
* A random 50% of the sample was accidentally sent the W10 instrument between
  July 22 and July 30, 2021.
* A random 91-98% of the sample was accidentally sent the W10 instrument between
  July 31 and August 1, 2021.

Despite differences between the two instruments, we have not detected trend
discontinuities as a result of the error. We will continue to investigate.

## Response Volume Drop (July 20-22, 2021)

On July 20, 2021, a technical problem in the process that samples Facebook users
for invitation to the survey caused lower-than-normal sample sizes. The problem
was resolved on July 22 and users that had been incorrectly not invited were
invited over the following several days. This caused sample sizes to temporarily
increase, compensating for the initial drop.

## Android Sampling Problem (June 17-24, 2021)

There was a bug in the in-app web browser in the Android version of the Facebook
app released on June 17. It affected all links within the Android version of the
Facebook app, not just the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and University of
Maryland (UMD) COVID-19 Trends and Impact Surveys, which are conducted in
partnership with Facebook. It did not affect links within other versions of
Facebook, including iOS. The issue has been fixed in the version of the Facebook
app released on June 24.

The issue caused a decrease in total response volume across the CMU and Maryland
surveys, since Android users who were invited could not take the surveys. As of
June 26, 2021, 89.5% of the initial decrease in total response volume has been
recovered. The response volume continued to recover as Android users updated to
the fixed version of the Facebook app.

## B13 Missing from Data Files (May-June 2021)

Survey item B13 was added in Wave 11 beginning May 20, 2021. Due to a survey
implementation bug, responses to B13 received between May 20 and June 16th were
not included in the API or in microdata files. This problem was fixed on June
16th; however, due to an oversight, certain microdata files were not corrected
to contain B13 responses until September 27, 2021. All files should now contain
responses to item B13 from the beginning of Wave 11.

## Incorrect Coding in Documentation

We found a Qualtrics bug that affects the exported text of the survey (but not
the survey instrument or underlying data). This bug affects questions where
response options are carried forward from the previous question.

For example, item C13 on waves 4-8 asked respondents to select which activities
they did in the previous 24 hours. Since item C13a asked respondents if they wore a 
mask while doing those activities, it was set up to carry forward response options 
from C13 so that the wording and numerical coding of response options matched 
between the two items.

The numerical coding of responses in C13 was not consecutive, but the 
documentation of C13a suggested that responses to it *were* coded consecutively. 
However, in the microdata made available to users with data access, the coding of
C13 and C13a is identical. It is the Qualtrics-exported document giving the coding 
that is in error.

We updated the [coding documentation](coding.md) on June 15, 2021 to correct the
documented coding of all affected items. The discrepancies that were caught and
fixed in the documentation are listed below:

- Items C13 and C13a, waves 4-8 and 10. The "None of the above" response option
  is affected, though this cannot normally be selected in C13a.
- Items B2 and B2c, wave 11. The "Stuffy or runny nose" response option is
  affected. The documentation suggested that it was coded as 20 in B2 and 6 on
  B2c, but it is actually consistently coded as 20 in both items.

## Mistranslation of Distances (May 2021)

In Wave 11, all items were re-translated to ensure consistency of the
translations. The new item H1, on social distancing, is:

> When out in public in the past 7 days, how many people maintained a distance
> of at least 6 feet from others?

In French, it was translated to read as follows:

> Lorsque vous êtes sorti(e) au cours des 7 derniers jours, combien de personnes
> ont maintenu une distance d’au moins 6 mètres entre elles ?

This incorrectly translated 6 feet to 6 meters. On June 7, 2021 at 9:50am
Pacific time, we corrected the text to read:

> Lorsque vous êtes sorti(e) au cours des 7 derniers jours, combien de personnes
> ont maintenu une distance d’au moins 2 mètres entre elles ?

This problem only affected the French translation. The `UserLanguage` column in
the survey data files indicates the translation used by each respondent to
complete the survey.

## Election-Related Sample Size Decreases (Nov 2020)

Sample sizes decreased in the days following the 2020 US presidential election.
During this time period, Facebook prioritized providing users with
election-related information, which led to fewer people seeing invitations to
the survey. Sample sizes returned to their pre-election baselines in mid-to-late
November.

## Missing Item C15 in Data Files (Nov 18, 2020)

In [Wave 4](coding.md), we added item C15, which asks respondents "How worried
are you about your household's finances for the next month?" Unfortunately, our
code that produces the [individual data files](survey-files.md) inadvertently
omitted this item.

We've now corrected this problem and reissued the data files that include
Wave 4. If you have access to the SFTP server containing microdata, you'll find
new response files with names such as

    cvid_responses_2020_10_31_recordedby_2020_11_16.csv.gz

where "recorded by 2020-11-16" means they were issued on November 16th. Older
versions with prior "recordedby" dates were created before this mistake was
corrected.

The monthly data files, with names such as 2020-11.csv.gz, use the reissued data
and are not affected by this problem.

## Unintended Highlighted Answer Choices (Feb 19, 2021)

Some respondents reported that certain multiple-choice questions displayed the
first response option highlighted in red. This occurred when a matrix-table
question is followed by a single-choice question. This problem only affected
respondents completing the survey on mobile devices; after completing the last
item in the matrix table question, Qualtrics automatically moved them to the
single-choice question and highlighted the first answer choice.

We have put in page breaks after the matrix-table questions that have seem to
resolve the issue. However, data collected before the problem was fixed may be
biased by the highlighting of the answer choice.

Listed below are the survey waves and items that were possibly affected:

* Wave 8 from February 8, 2021 – February 19, 2021:
  * Item V9 (How concerned are you that you would experience a side effect from
    a COVID-19 vaccination?)
  * Item C9 (How worried do you feel that you or someone in your immediate
    family might become seriously ill from COVID-19?)
* Wave 7 from January 12, 2021 – January 28, 2021:
  * Item V9 (How concerned are you that you would experience a side effect from
    a COVID-19 vaccination?)
  * Item C9 (How worried do you feel that you or someone in your immediate
    family might become seriously ill from COVID-19?)
* Waves 1, 4, 5, and 6:
  * Item C9 (How worried do you feel that you or someone in your immediate
    family might become seriously ill from COVID-19?)
