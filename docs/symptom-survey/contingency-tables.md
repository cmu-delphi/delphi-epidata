# Contingency Tables
{: .no_toc}

This documentation describes the fine-resolution contingency tables produced by
grouping [US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS)](./index.md) individual
responses by various self-reported demographic features. The contingency tables
are publicly available for download as a complete set from the Inter-university
Consortium for Political Science Research (ICPSR):

Select the dataset "DS0 Study-Level Files" to download the complete set of
contingency tables and all survey documentation files, including the codebooks
and an Aggregate Contingency Table User Guide that describes the data
processing and file formats, and includes example R code.

These contingency tables provide granular breakdowns of COVID-related topics
such as vaccine uptake and acceptance. Compatible tables are also available for
the [UMD Global CTIS](https://covidmap.umd.edu/) for more than 100 countries and
territories worldwide, also [through
ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/39206).

These tables are more detailed than the [coarse aggregates reported in the
COVIDcast Epidata API](../api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.md), which are grouped
only by geographic region. [Individual response data](survey-files.md) for the
survey is available, but only to researchers who request restricted data access
via ICPSR, whereas these contingency tables are available to the general public.

Our [Data and Sampling Errors](problems.md) documentation lists important
updates for data users, including corrections to data or updates on data
processing delays.
