# Getting Data Access

The Delphi Research Group at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), in partnership
with Facebook, has conducted the COVID Symptom Survey to better understand the
spread of COVID-19 and its effects on public health and well-being. This may
help improve our local and national responses to the pandemic and our
understanding of how it has affected society.

[High-level aggregates](../api/covidcast.md) of select survey items are
publicly available in the [COVIDcast API](../api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.md).
[Finer aggregates](./contingency-tables.md) grouped by various demographic
characteristics are available for download.

## Getting Microdata Access

De-identified individual survey responses can be made available to researchers
associated with universities or non-profit organizations who sign a Data Use
Agreement (DUA). To request access to the data please submit the information
requested in [Facebook's page on obtaining data
access](https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/),
which sets out the basic conditions and provides a form to request access. An
[international version of the COVID Symptom Survey](https://covidmap.umd.edu/)
is conducted by the University of Maryland (UMD) and access can be requested
through the same form.

The United States survey protocol has been reviewed by the Carnegie Mellon
University Institutional Review Board with IRB ID STUDY2020_00000162.

Some important notes about obtaining access to the individual survey responses:

* Your research purpose must be consistent with the consent language used in
  [Wave 1 of the survey](coding.md#wave-1), which states the responses may be
  used to create "a better public health understanding of where the coronavirus
  pandemic is moving, to improve our local and national responses." While the
  consent language [changed in Wave 4](coding.md#wave-4) to allow more uses, we
  are not currently able to adjust the DUAs to support different use cases.
* Part- or full-time employees of Facebook are **not** eligible to receive data
  access, since Delphi's agreement with Facebook to protect the privacy of
  respondents prohibits Facebook employees from receiving any microdata.
* Because this survey is large and many groups have access, the Data Use
  Agreements are not negotiable.

After you complete the request form, staff from Facebook and CMU will be in
contact to guide you through the rest of the process. They will provide data use
agreements for your institution to sign, and will also request a copy of your
Institutional Review Board approval to verify you have ethical approval to
conduct the research.

After the DUAs are executed, we will ask you to fill out [this
form](http://cmu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_89aVsYl29Oay4qq) to set up your
microdata access. This form can be used for new research projects or adding new
researchers to existing projects.

After completing these forms, credentials for SFTP will be emailed to each
individual on the team. Please **do not share your credentials** with other
users. Only one person per research team needs to fill out this survey. You can
list all relevant team members in one submission. For teams with more than 5
members, please fill out an additional form(s) to cover your whole team.

If you have questions about the process, or your IRB needs information
about the survey for their review, contact us at
