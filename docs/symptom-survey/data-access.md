# Getting Data Access

The Delphi Research Group at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), in partnership
with Facebook, has conducted the COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) to
better understand the spread of COVID-19 and its effects on public health and
well-being. This may help improve our local and national responses to the
pandemic and our understanding of how it has affected society.

[High-level aggregates](../api/covidcast.md) of select survey items are
publicly available in the [COVIDcast API](../api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.md).
[Finer aggregates](./contingency-tables.md) grouped by various demographic
characteristics are available for download.

## Getting Microdata Access

De-identified individual survey responses can be made available to researchers
associated with universities or non-profit organizations who agree to a Data Use
Agreement (DUA). The microdata is archived by the Inter-university Consortium
for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan:

* Reinhart, Alex, Mejia, Robin, and Tibshirani, Ryan J. COVID-19 Trends and
  Impact Survey (CTIS), United States, 2020-2022. Inter-university Consortium
  for Political and Social Research [distributor], 2025-02-28.

Follow the link to view the data description and documentation, and to request
access to the restricted microdata. The survey documentation, including full
codebooks and user guides, is available for public download. Microdata access is
no longer available through direct agreements with Carnegie Mellon University,
so all access must be requested through ICPSR.

The United States survey protocol has been reviewed by the Carnegie Mellon
University Institutional Review Board with IRB ID STUDY2020_00000162.

Some important notes about obtaining access to the individual survey responses:

* You should be familiar with the [survey's limitations](limitations.md) and
  ensure the survey data is suitable for your research goals.
* Your research purpose must be consistent with the consent language used in
  [Wave 1 of the survey](coding.md#wave-1), which states the responses may be
  used to create "a better public health understanding of where the coronavirus
  pandemic is moving, to improve our local and national responses." While the
  consent language [changed in Wave 4](coding.md#wave-4) to allow more uses, we
  are not currently able to adjust the DUAs to support different use cases.
* Part- or full-time employees of Facebook are **not** eligible to receive data
  access, since Delphi's agreement with Facebook to protect the privacy of
  respondents prohibits Facebook employees from receiving any microdata.

If you have questions about the process, or your IRB needs information
about the survey for their review, contact us at

restricted data access process, contact ICPSR through the forms or email
addresses on their website.
