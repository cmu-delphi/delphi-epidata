# Survey Weights
{: .no_toc}

The symptom survey individual response files contain survey weights calculated
by Facebook. These weights are also used to produce our [public contingency tables](contingency-tables.md)
and the geographic aggregates [in the COVIDcast Epidata API](../api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.md).

Facebook has provided documentation to describe the calculation and usage of
these weights, [available here](symptom-survey-weights.pdf). This documentation
explains the weight methodology, gives examples of how to use the weights when
calculating estimates, and states the known limitations of the weights.
