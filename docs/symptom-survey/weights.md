# Survey Weights
{: .no_toc}

The survey's individual response files contain respondent weights calculated
by Facebook. These weights are also used to produce our
[public contingency tables](./contingency-tables.md) and the geographic aggregates
[in the COVIDcast Epidata API](../api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.md).

Facebook has developed a [User Guide for the CTIS
Weights](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/resources/user-guide-for-ctis-weights)
(updated May 2022). This manual explains the weight methodology, gives examples
of how to use the weights when calculating estimates, and states the known
limitations of the weights. We also have separate information about the
[survey's limitations](limitations.md) that affect what conclusions can be drawn
from the survey data.
