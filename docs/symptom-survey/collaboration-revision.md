# Collaboration and Survey Revision

<div style="background-color:#f5f6fa; padding: 10px
30px;"><strong>Update:</strong> CTIS data collection has ended. We are no longer
revising the survey or hosting collaboration meetings.</div>

Delphi continues to revise the COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS)
instruments in order to prioritize items that have the greatest utility for the
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We conduct revisions in collaboration with
data users, fellow researchers, and public health officials, to ensure the
survey data best serves public health and research goals.

## Proposing Revisions

If there is a revision or question you would like us to consider, please fill
out [this form requesting details about your
proposal](https://forms.gle/q6NS8fPJJofKQ9mM8). This request can be submitted by
researchers regardless of whether they have a signed Data Use Agreement for the
individual responses to the COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey.

## Collaboration Meetings

Collaboration in this ongoing effort is our priority. Delphi hosts a
collaboration meeting the first Friday of each month at 2–3pm ET. The meeting is
a chance to announce upcoming changes to the survey, have a discussion and get
input about the instrument, share preliminary findings and network with other
researchers.
