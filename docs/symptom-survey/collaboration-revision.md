# Collaboration and Survey Revision

Delphi continues to revise the COVID-19 Symptom Survey instruments in order to
prioritize items that have the greatest utility for the response to the COVID-19
pandemic. We conduct revisions in collaboration with data users, fellow
researchers, and public health officials, to ensure the survey data best serves
public health and research goals.

## Proposing Revisions

If there is a revision or question you would like us to consider, please fill
out [this form requesting details about your
proposal](https://forms.gle/q6NS8fPJJofKQ9mM8). This request can be submitted by
researchers regardless of whether they have a signed Data Use Agreement for the
individual responses to the COVID Symptom Survey.

## Collaboration Meetings

Collaboration in this ongoing effort is our priority. Delphi hosts a
collaboration meeting the first Friday of each month at 2â€“3pm ET. The meeting is
a chance to announce upcoming changes to the survey, have a discussion and get
input about the instrument, share preliminary findings and network with other
researchers.
