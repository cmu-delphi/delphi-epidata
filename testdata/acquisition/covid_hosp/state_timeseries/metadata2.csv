These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across three main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities and (3) National Healthcare Safety Network (before July 15).\n<br>\n<br>The file will be updated regularly and provides the latest values reported by each facility within the last four days for all time. This allows for a more comprehensive picture of the hospital utilization within a state by ensuring a hospital is represented, even if they miss a single day of reporting.\n<br>\n<br>No statistical analysis is applied to account for non-response and/or to account for missing data.\n<br>\n<br>The below table displays one value for each field (i.e., column). Sometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to more than one reporting source: HHS TeleTracking, NHSN, and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, prioritization is applied to the numbers for each facility."", ""Archive Repository"": ""https://healthdata.gov/d/qqte-vkut"", ""Contact Email"": ""HealthData@hhs.gov"", ""Language"": ""English"", ""Contact Name"": ""HealthData.gov Team"", ""Update Frequency"": ""R/P1W"", ""Last Update"": ""3/13/2021 13:06 AM"", ""Program Code"": ""009:028"", ""Publisher"": ""U.S. Department of Health & Human Services"", ""Is Quality Data"": ""true"", ""Bureau Code"": ""009:0"", ""Public Access Level"": ""public"", ""rowLabel"": ""Daily State Aggregated Report""}","{""updates"": {""Update Frequency"": ""R/P1W"", ""Program Code"": ""009:028"", ""Is Quality Data"": ""true"", ""Bureau Code"": ""009:0"", ""Public Access Level"": ""public""}, ""additions"": {}, ""deletions"": {}}","[{""name"": ""state"", ""dataTypeName"": ""text"", ""description"": ""1.
