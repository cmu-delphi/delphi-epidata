These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.\n\nThe hospital population includes all hospitals registered with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as of June 1, 2020. It includes non-CMS hospitals that have reported since July 15, 2020. It does not include psychiatric, rehabilitation, Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, Defense Health Agency (DHA) facilities, and religious non-medical facilities.\n\nFor a given entry, the term \u201ccollection_week\u201d signifies the start of the period that is aggregated. For example, a \u201ccollection_week\u201d of 2020-11-20 means the average/sum/coverage of the elements captured from that given facility starting and including Friday, November 20, 2020, and ending and including reports for Thursday, November 26, 2020.\n\nReported elements include an append of either \u201c_coverage\u201d, \u201c_sum\u201d, or \u201c_avg\u201d.\n<ul>\n<li>A \u201c_coverage\u201d append denotes how many times the facility reported that element during that collection week.</li>\n<li>A \u201c_sum\u201d append denotes the sum of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.</li>\n<li>A \u201c_avg\u201d append is the average of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.</li></ul>\n\nThe file will be updated weekly. No statistical analysis is applied to impute non-response. For averages, calculations are based on the number of values collected for a given hospital in that collection week. Suppression is applied to the file for sums and averages less than four (4). In these cases, the field will be replaced with \u201c-999,999\u201d.\n\nThis data is preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data is available starting on July 31, 2020.\n\nSometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to both HHS TeleTracking and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, deduplication is applied according to prioritization rules within HHS Protect.\n\nFor influenza fields listed in the file, the current HHS guidance marks these fields as optional. As a result, coverage of these elements are varied."", ""Archive Repository"": ""https://healthdata.gov/d/j4ip-wfsv"", ""Contact Email"": ""HealthData@hhs.gov"", ""Language"": ""English"", ""Contact Name"": ""HealthData.gov Team"", ""Update Frequency"": ""R/P1W"", ""Last Update"": ""March 15, 2021"", ""Program Code"": ""009:028"", ""Publisher"": ""U.S. Department of Health & Human Services"", ""Is Quality Data"": ""true"", ""Bureau Code"": ""009:0"", ""Public Access Level"": ""public"", ""rowLabel"": ""Aggregated Facility Report for a Given Collection Week""}","{""updates"": {""Update Frequency"": ""R/P1W"", ""Last Update"": ""March 15, 2021"", ""Program Code"": ""009:028"", ""Is Quality Data"": ""true"", ""Bureau Code"": ""009:0"", ""Public Access Level"": ""public""}, ""additions"": {}, ""deletions"": {}}","[{""name"": ""hospital_pk"", ""dataTypeName"": ""text"", ""description"": ""This unique key for the given hospital that will match the ccn column if it exists, otherwise, it is a derived unique key."", ""fieldName"": ""hospital_pk""}, {""name"": ""collection_week"", ""dataTypeName"": ""calendar_date"", ""description"": ""This date indicates the start of the period of reporting (the starting Friday)."", ""fieldName"": ""collection_week""}, {""name"": ""state"", ""dataTypeName"": ""text"", ""description"": ""[FAQ - 1. d)] The two digit state/territory code for the hospital."", ""fieldName"": ""state""}, {""name"": ""ccn"", ""dataTypeName"": ""text"", ""description"": ""[FAQ - 1. b)] CMS Certification Number (CCN) of the given facility"", ""fieldName"": ""ccn""}, {""name"": ""hospital_name"", ""dataTypeName"": ""text"", ""description"": ""[FAQ - 1. a)] The name of the facility reporting."", ""fieldName"": ""hospital_name""}, {""name"": ""address"", ""dataTypeName"": ""text"", ""description"": ""The address of the facility reporting."", ""fieldName"": ""address""}, {""name"": ""city"", ""dataTypeName"": ""text"", ""description"": ""The city of the facility reporting."", ""fieldName"": ""city""}, {""name"": ""zip"", ""dataTypeName"": ""text"", ""description"": ""The 5-digit zip code of the facility reporting."", ""fieldName"": ""zip""}, {""name"": ""hospital_subtype"", ""dataTypeName"": ""text"", ""description"": ""The sub-type of the facility reporting.
