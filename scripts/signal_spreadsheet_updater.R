# This is a helper script for updating the signal spreadsheet "Signals" tab
# (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zb7ItJzY5oq1n-2xtvnPBiJu2L3AqmCKubrLkKJZVHs/edit#gid=329338228)
# semi-programmatically.
#
# To run this, you need to have the Signals tab and the Sources tab saved
# locally as CSVs. The script loads and modifies the data from the Signals tab.
#
# To update a given field, we define a map between data source names and a set
# of values, use the data source column to index into the map, and save the
# result to the spreadsheet. There is some additional logic, depending on the
# field to be updated, to handle certain signals and cases (active/inactive
# signals) separately.
#
# The updated spreadsheet is saved to disk as a CSV. Any updated columns must be
# manually pasted into the online spreadsheet. This script checks that the
# original sort order is the same as that of the updated spreadsheet.
